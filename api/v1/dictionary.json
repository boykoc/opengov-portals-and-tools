  This builds the basic API for the site.
  The data is stored in_data/tools.json and could be
  accessed there by making a request to
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boykoc/opengov-portals-and-tools/master/_data/tools.json.
  But this relies more on github and I thought it
  would be fun to try exporting the datafile(s)
  through the website instead.

  Refer to api/index.md

{{ site.data.tools.data-dictionary | jsonify }}
