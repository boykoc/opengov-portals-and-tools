# Open Government Portals and Policy Tools Across Canada

This is an adaptation of a chart found on page 23 of the OpenNorth _[What Could Open Data Programs Gain from Aligning with International Best Practices?](http://public.citizenbudget.com/uploads/custom/on.ca/ODCinCanada.pdf)_ report from 2016.

This chart summarizes open government portals and policy tools in Canada at a Federal, Provincial and Municipal level.

We hope to use this webpage as an ongoing record of the current Open Government portal and policy tool landscape across Canada and would love as many updates and additions as possible.
